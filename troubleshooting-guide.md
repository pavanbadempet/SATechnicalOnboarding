# Technical Onboarding Troubleshooting Guide

Below are common issues faced by Student Ambassadors while completing the Technical Onboarding and possible solutions to some of them. This document has been authored by Darsh Manoj, Microsoft Learn Gold Student Ambassador.
 
It is recommended that you watch the [Completing the Technical Onboarding video](https://stdntpartners.sharepoint.com/sites/MSPOpen2/Shared%20Documents/Ambassador%20Events/Recordings/Completing%20the%20Technical%20Onboarding-20220329_162029-Meeting%20Recording.mp4?web=1), which is a silent video that walks through the Azure part of the onboarding from scratch and might help resolve some of your issues.

## You are unable to verify the university ID

This happens when you try to sign up for Azure for Students but receive an error saying that the university ID is not valid. 
 
The best way to get around this is to first get to the Alpha level. Despite what it may seem like, you do not need to complete Technical Onboarding to get Alpha status – it’s needed only for Beta. Once you get to the Alpha level, you can then easily use your Student Ambassador account to proceed as normal.

## You are asked to enter credit card details

This happens when you try to sign up for the Azure trial offer. 
 
Stop. You're in the wrong place. Go back and either sign up for [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/), or get to the Alpha level and then use your Azure subscription.

## You receive an error that .git repository already exists 

This happens when you have a parent folder that (perhaps accidentally) is a .git folder.
 
To fix this, navigate to the parent folder.  The error message should describe which folder already has the .git repository.
 
Then, select the option to view hidden files/folders (if you haven't already done this) - you should see a .git folder. Delete it. Then this error should not occur. 

## You receive an error in GitHub Actions

This may also include an error message when you try to build and deploy a job.
 
One possible cause for this is not having emptied the build location when asked. You will need to restart the whole process in that case. 

## You aren't sure if you have completed the Technical Onboarding

Ensure that you have completed the [Onboarding Completion Form](https://forms.office.com/r/UnJgmjap4U). If you're sure that you've completed the form, your Student Ambassador Comumunity Program Manager (CPM) will contact you regardless of if you have accurately completed the technical onboarding process). 

## Your issue is something else or you're still stuck

Create a post in the Technical Onboarding channel in the Student Ambassador Teams tenant that details the issue you are facing.

- Make sure your post describes the issue clearly
- Make sure you provide the steps taken to reach there (that is, what did you do)
- Make sure you provide relevant screenshots that describe the problem clearly
